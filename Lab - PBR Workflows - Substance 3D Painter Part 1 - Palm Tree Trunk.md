# Lab - Smart Materials Creation in Substance Painter

*In this lab, we will create a **stylized palm tree trunk** material using Substance Painter. By the end, you will understand smart materials, layer masks, generators, filters, and blending modes. These techniques can be used for a host of different stylized or realistic surfaces*

### Introduction

Smart materials in Substance Painter allow for dynamic, reusable materials using layers, masks, and procedural effects. In this lab, we will build a detailed texture for the **trunk** of a stylized palm tree.

This material will showcase Substance Painter's capabilities using baked input textures (e.g., curvature, ambient occlusion, thickness), library assets like grunge and noise maps, and dynamic blending. We will use **generators**, **filters**, and **masks** to add wear, depth, and stylistic detail, resulting in a striking trunk texture. The lab doesn't cover baking as these processes may change in future updates, or you may complete your bakes in other tools.

The lab encourages creative experimentation while maintaining a procedural workflow.

### Core Concepts

#### **1. Layers and Layer Types**

Substance Painter's layers control channels like **Base Color**, **Roughness**, **Metallic**, and **Normal**.

- **Fill Layers**: Apply textures or colors uniformly.
- **Paint Layers**: Add hand-painted details.
- **Mask Layers**: Blend or isolate parts of a material.

---

#### **2. Masks and Masking Techniques**

Masks define where materials or effects are applied.

- **Black/White Masks**: White reveals, black conceals.
- **Generator Masks**: Driven by baked maps (e.g., curvature, AO).
- **Custom Masks**: Hand-painted or imported for specific effects.

---

#### **3. Input Maps from Baking**

Baked textures drive procedural effects, including:

- **Curvature**: Highlights edges and ridges for wear effects.
- **Ambient Occlusion (AO)**: Shadows in crevices.
- **Position**: Spatial orientation of the object.
- **Thickness**: Identifies thin or hollow areas for unique effects.

---

#### **4. Generators and Filters**

Generators and filters create dynamic effects.

- **Edge Wear Generator**: Adds wear based on curvature.
- **Dirt Generator**: Uses AO and grunge maps for organic overlays.
- **Grunge and Noise Maps**: Add variation.
- **Filters**: Blur, sharpen, or stylize layer effects.

---

#### **5. Blending Modes and Opacity**

Blending modes control how layers interact.

- **Multiply**, **Overlay**, and **Screen**: Add depth and variation.
- **Opacity Adjustments**: Control transparency and integration of effects.

---

#### **6. Library Assets**

Substance Painter's library provides various assets:

- **Grunge Maps**: Add wear and variation.
- **Noise Maps**: Enhance texture.
- **Brushes**: Manual detail and masking.
- **Alpha Maps**: Patterns for stamping or masking.

### Section 7 - Adding Baked Lighting for Stylized Enhancement

#### **Layer 7 - Baked Lighting Effect**

Adding baked lighting can enhance the appearance of stylized assets, especially for games with limited lighting. This layer will introduce baked lighting to emphasize surface details and add depth.

### Section 8 - Saving the Smart Material

#### **Final Step - Organize and Save as a Smart Material**

To wrap up, we will organize all the layers and save them as a reusable smart material.

1. **Group All Layers**
   - Select all the layers in the Layers panel.
   - Right-click on the selected layers and choose **Create Folder** to group them.
   - Name the folder appropriately, such as **Palm Tree Trunk Material**.

2. **Save as a Smart Material**
   - Right-click on the newly created folder and select **Create Smart Material**.
   - This will save your grouped layers as a **Smart Material**, which you can reuse for other parts of the palm tree or future projects.

> *N.B - Saving your material as a Smart Material ensures consistency across similar assets and saves time when creating multiple stylized elements.*
